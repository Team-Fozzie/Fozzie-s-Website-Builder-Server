# Fozzie's Website Builder

**Author**: Alexander Stone, Justin Morris, Madeline Peters, Amanda Moen, Maxwell Rediker.

**Version**: 0.1.0 

## Overview
This project allows a user to build a basic website layout and get the HTML and CSS back that matches their creation.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone the files from GitHub and install all necessary dependencies. From your psql command:
CREATE TABLE users (user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, username VARCHAR(255), email VARCHAR(255), password VARCHAR(255));

CREATE TABLE projects (project_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, project_name VARCHAR(255), user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id), html TEXT, css TEXT );

Then in your command line:
heroku pg:push fozzie postgresql-vertical-34898 --app fozzie-web-builder

Or, more easily, just open our deployed version and save yourself some work.
